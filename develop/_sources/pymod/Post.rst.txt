.. function:: makeUniqueFilePrefix()

    :returns: a string on the form ``out/iii_`` where ```iii``` is the next zero-padded integer
        from an internal counter.
    :rtype: str
.. module:: post

    The ``post`` submodule contains various functions to manipulate post-processing (:ref:`mod_post`).
    Commands for the post-processor are written to the command file ``out/post.sh``
    which the post-processor executes internally as a Bash script.

    .. function:: command(line)

        Write the given text to the command file and write a newline character.

        :param str line: the text to be written.

        .. warning:: The contents of the command file is executed without any security checks.
    .. function:: flushCommands()

        Flush the command file buffer.
    .. function:: disableCommands()

        Disable command writing and flushing, also for commands emitted internally in the library.
    .. function:: enableCommands()

        Enable command writing and flushing, also for commands emitted internally in the library.
    .. function:: reopenCommandFile()

        Reopen the command file, which may be useful if it was modified externally while open by the library.
    .. function:: summaryChapter(heading)

        Command the post-processor to insert a ``\chapter`` macro in the summary.

        :param str heading: the chapter heading to insert.
    .. function:: summarySection(heading)

        Command the post-processor to insert a ``\section`` macro in the summary.

        :param str heading: the section heading to insert.
    .. function:: summaryRaw(latexCode, file=...)

        Command the post-processor to insert the given code verbatim in the summary.

        :param str latexCode: the code to insert.
        :param str file: if given then that will be appended to a unique prefix for the final filename the code is stored in.
    .. function:: summaryInput(filename)

        Command the post-processor to insert a ``\input`` macro in the summary.

        :param str filename: the filename to input.
    .. function:: disableInvokeMake()
                      enableInvokeMake()

        Disable/enable the invocation of Make in the post-processor.
        The processing of commands and generation of Makefiles will still be carried out,
        and Make invocation can be done manually afterwards through the post-processor
    .. function:: disableCompileSummary()
                      enableCompileSummary()

        Disable/enable the compilation of the final summary during post-processing.
        The compilation can be invoked manually afterwards through the post-processor.
