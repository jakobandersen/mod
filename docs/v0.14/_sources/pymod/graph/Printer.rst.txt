.. class:: GraphPrinter

    This class is used to configure how graphs are visualised.

    .. warning:: Some of these options greatly alter how graphs are depicted
        and the result may not accurately represent the underlying graph,
        and may make non-molecules look like molecules.

    .. method:: __init__()

        The default constructor enables edges as bonds, raised charges, and raised isotopes.
    .. method:: setMolDefault()

        Shortcut for enabling all but thickening and index printing.
    .. method:: setReactionDefault()

        Shortcut for enabling all but thickening, index printing and simplification of carbon atoms.
    .. method:: disableAll()

        Disable all special printing features.
    .. method:: enableAll()

        Enable all special printing features, except typewriter font.
    .. attribute:: edgesAsBonds

        Control whether edges with special labels are drawn as chemical bonds.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: collapseHydrogens

        Control whether vertices representing hydrogen atoms are collapsed into their neighbours labels.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: raiseIsotopes

        Control whether a vertex label prefix encoding an isotope is written as a superscript to the rest of the label.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: raiseCharges

        Control whether a vertex label suffix encoding a charge is written as a superscript to the rest of the label.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: simpleCarbons

        Control whether some vertices encoding carbon atoms are depicted without any label.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: thick

        Control whether all edges are drawn thicker than normal and all labels are written in bold.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: withColour

        Control whether colour is applied to certain elements of the graph which are molecule-like.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: withIndex

        Control whether the underlying indices of the vertices are printed.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: withTexttt

        Control whether the vertex and edge labels are written with typewriter font.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: withRawStereo

        Control whether the vertices and edges are annotated with the raw stereo properties.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: withPrettyStereo

        Control whether the vertices and edges are annotated with stylized stereo properties.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: rotation

        Rotation of internally computed coordinates.

        :type: int
    .. attribute:: mirror

        Mirror internally computed coordinates in the y-axis.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: withGraphvizCoords

        Do not use Open Babel for coordinate generation, but only the Graphviz fallback
        during post-processing.
        When setting this to ``True`` consider setting `simpleCarbons = False`` to avoid
        misleading depictions due to colinear carbon chains.

        :type: bool
    .. attribute:: graphvizPrefix

        The string that will be inserted into generated DOT files,
        just after the graph declaration.
        DOT files are only generated when ``withGraphvizCoords == True``.

        :type: str
